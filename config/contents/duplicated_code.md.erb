## Duplicated Code

Duplicated code can lead to software that is hard to understand and difficult to change. The Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY) principle states:

> Every piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous, authoritative representation within a system.

When you violate DRY, bugs and maintenance problems are sure to follow. Duplicated code has a tendency to both continue to replicate and also to diverge (leaving bugs as two similar implementations differ in subtle ways).

## Issue Mass

Duplicated code has a calculated mass, which can be thought of as a measure of how much logic has been duplicated.
This issue has a mass of `<%= mass %>`: if you would like to change the minimum mass that will be reported as an issue, please see the details in [`codeclimate-duplication`'s documentation](https://docs.codeclimate.com/docs/duplication).
